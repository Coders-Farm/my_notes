The My notes project is Based on three main pillers.

1) MVVM Architecture
2) HILT dependency injection
3) Room Database

In this project I have used HILT to make singletons for Network module which creates and login user to the application.Moreover for the rest of the functionality I have used local storage "Room Database".

Also I have written unit test cases for repositories,servies and viewmodels to check application works perfectly without any break in the logic.

The API I have used is free api provided by the "https://reqres.in/".

And it is works based of the static credentials.

so for the login you can use below credentials,

Email: eve.holt@reqres.in
Password: cityslicka

And for the Create account you can use,

Email: eve.holt@reqres.in
Password: pistol

This project is for the beginners who want to know how we can implement the MVVM using HILT and Room database.also experience developers can refresh their logic check the usage.
